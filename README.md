# // Library name //

// Library logo (left wrap with title) //

// OPTIONAL: A single image/screenshot/GIF descriptive of the main library function. You can stitch multiple images so they fit better horizontally if there are more things to show. //

// OPTIONAL: If there are any additional modules/plugins, list and describe them here //

## Getting started

// Groovy and KotlinDSL snippets for including the library (and its modules) //

### Usage

// Explain the basic code setup and usage of the library with relevant code snippets. //

### // OPTIONAL: Configuration //

// How to further configure the library, list any additional options //

### // OPTIONAL: Specific usage info //

// Depending on the complexity of the library, you might have one or more sections where you explain specific use-cases which do not fall under "basic" usage. You **should not** cover the whole API here, just some of the more common usages of the library. //

## Requirements

// e.g., API 21, AndroidX, other libraries //

### // OPTIONAL // Known issues

// List known issues which are critical to the basic library functions //
